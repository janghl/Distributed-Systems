## Instructions
We have provided the server code for all 10 VM's. This is in server<num>.py. The code for each of these is the exact same, except that the DNS_name is different for each of the servers. There is also client.py. This can be used in any of the VMs. 

To run the code, run server<num>.py on the corresponding machines. After server<num>.py is running on all machines, run client.py on any of the machines. The machine where client.py runs is the querying machine. 

For the testcases. We have provided server_test.py which only tests on VM 1 but this can be changed by changing the DNS name to the VM you want to test. Using this, we tested with multiple VM's running simultaneously. To run the test cases, run server_test.py on multiple machines. Then, run test.py on any machine. The output for the test cases will be displayed in test.py
